# *Drunken Octopus* Marlin: An Alternative (Unofficial) Firmware for Aleph Objects Printers and Derivatives

*Drunken Octopus* is a fork of the firmware that was used on Aleph Objects printers (a.k.a. LulzBot) prior to the [layoff of 2019] and the subsequent take over and [relocation of the company].

By forking the firmware as it existed at that point in time, I hope provide to provide a resource to people who, like myself, still use Aleph Objects printers in some capacity. This fork also supports newer printers [that are derived from those original designs] as well as users who want to take their printers beyond their original configuration.

## Who can benefit from *Drunken Octopus* Marlin?

This firmware is for users who want the very latest firmware and features for their existing printers and **are willing to take the risks associated with running development firmware**. It is also for people who are tech savvy and want to experiment with custom and unusual configurations.

## Where can I find information about upgrading my printer?

If you have a pretty good idea of what you want to do, a good place to start is the [wiring guide] for *Drunken Octopus* Marlin.

If you want more help and specifics, a community of enthusiasts has begun to form around *Drunken Octopus* Marlin. These volunteers are publishing guides, documentation and resources at [drunkenoctop.us].

# How can you support my work?

:heart: **If you would like to support my work on open-source projects, please consider contributions via my [Patreon page]**. :heart:

While at AlephObjects, I was a [major contributor] to Marlin. Today, I [continue to contribute] in the following ways:

* Maintaining *Drunken Octopus* Marlin* build and configuration scripts
* Keeping *Drunken Octopus* Marlin up-to-date with upstream changes and fixing bugs as they occur
* Maintaining the touch screen interface that is used in [many] [different] [printers]
* Contributing to other open-source projects, related and unrelated to 3D printing

All Patreon supporters will receive pre-compiled firmware for hundreds of different *Drunken Octopus* Marlin variants.
Supporters may also receive additional member-only perks.

# License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
